# Image sorter (imgsort)

Simple tool for moving image and movie files into folder hierarchy based on when the image/movie was recorded. Folder structure: `year` -> `month` -> `day`.

`imgsort` is dependent on [https://exiftool.org/](ExifTool) being installed, and uses [https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool](PyExifTool) to interact with ExifTool.
